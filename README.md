Spooncular Kitchen
Written with React and HTML/CSS. Using the Spooncular API in order to pull recipes.
The site allows you to look at all recipes, split into 6 per page. User can filter by cuisines type. Selecting a recipe displays information on the recipes instructions, ingredients, and dietary restrictions. I hope this helps someone decide dinner faster! Site is hosted on github pages here. https://guapomopo.github.io/blueCross/
